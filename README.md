A Novel and Simple Method for Panchromatic Sharpening 

D. E. Canbay, "A novel and simple method for panchromatic sharpening," 2018 26th Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference (SIU), Izmir, Turkey, 2018, pp. 1-3, doi: 10.1109/SIU.2018.8404640.Abstract: Panchromatic sharpening methods are frequently used in remote sensing technologies where satellite images are processed to obtain more useful forms. Obtaining high resolution images, by combining the images collected via different sensors with various wave lengths and resolutions, is very useful in imaging water resources, agricultural areas, forests, etc. In this study, applicaiton of a simple and very fast panchromatic sharpening method is presented including a comperative analysis (in terms of quality metrics) with the existing methods in the literature. keywords: {Remote sensing;Artificial satellites;Earth;Principal component analysis;Satellites;Image resolution;Measurement;Panchromatic sharpening;IHS;Brovey;YUV420;remote sensing;satellite image;LANDSAT},URL:Â https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8404640&isnumber=8404147

This repository include my Matlab codes for the following panchromatic sharpening methods below. 

Brovey, Gram-Schmidt, PCA, IHS, Wavelet and the proposed YUV422
